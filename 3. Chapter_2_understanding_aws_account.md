# Chapter 2: Understanding AWS Account

## Overview

Amazon Web Service is a huge service with more than 100 services.

Things to be clear about:
- **What is the cost?**: cloud services are scalable and have no limit on how much one can spend
- **Who will be in charge?**: Decisions related to creating and shutting down resources

## Key Concepts

### The Free Tier

AWS provides 12 months of Free tier upon account creation to experiment light weight services. This is capped to a specific number of hours and additional hours are billed.  

#### Tracking Free Tier Usage

- **Email alerts**: Emails are automatically sent whenever the free tier limit has been exceeded.

- **Usage Tracking Tool**: Available on the dashboard for all accounts that are still under free trial. 


#### What is available under free trial usage
There are two types of free trial offerings:
1. Light weight implementation of most AWS services for the first 12 months
2. Light usage of some of the AWS services even after 12 months 

#### Permanently Free Services
Some services are availed for free by AWS because they are consumed at levels so low that they do not need to be billed. These services may include CloudWatch, Amazon Glacier, Simple Mail Service and Lambda functions. 
### Product Pricing
While launching services, it is important to understand how products are priced in AWS. Pricing can vary according to regions and other aspects. 


## Working with Online Calculators
AWS provides two calculation tools to visualize the costs of deploy. These are: 
- **Simple Monthly Calculator**: Helps in understanding the cost of running a combination of AWS services
- **Total Cost of Ownership Calculator**: Assists in comparing costs of running on premise versus on AWS 

## Service Limits
The total scope of the AWS cloud is vast due to significant amount of resources that is available to customers. As a result, AWS enforces a limit on the scope of the resources that can be used. For example, one is limited on the number of EC2 m5.large instances they can operate at a time within a single AWS region. This is important for 2 reasons:
- Ensuring all classes of resources are available on demand for everyone and not held by a few large customers. 
- Protect users from maliciosly/accidentally launching resources that could result into unsustainable costs. 

However, limits on some of the resources can be adjusted.

## Billing and cost management
There are various tools that can be utilized to oversight billing and cost in AWS
1. **The AWS Billing Dashboard**: Contains helpful visual spending summary that displays costs of the current and previous month and the forecast of what is likely to be spent at the end of the month. It also contains a link to payment history page where previous month to month usage can be viewed. 

2. **AWS Budget**: A tool that is used to track certain events and triggers notifications such as emails when a certain treshold is reached. 

## Monitoring Costs 
Although budgets are important they are not enough, hence the need for more tools to monitor costs. 

- **Cost Explorer**: Allows visualization of historical and current costs using graphs. 
- **Cost and Report usage**: Apart from the cost and usage reports available on the billing page, it is also possible to configure reports to be created. The reports can be generated at specified intervals and even exported as CSV files to the s3 bucket. 
- **Cost Allocation tags**: Tags are metadata identification elements that represent a resource and its actions. They can be utilized in organizing and tracking resources for visualization and better understanding of how resources are being used. AWS provides 2 types of tags 
1. ***Resource Tags***: Used to identify a resource and the owner of a running resource. 
2. ***Cost allocation tags***: Used in identification of resources for purpose of tracking spending. They are AWS allocated tags and those generated by the user. 

## AWS Organizations 
Multiple accounts owned by a single company can be centralized in AWS. 

## Summary
- Free tier provides free access to light configurations to most of AWS services. The goal is to be comfortable with the AWS environment and learn how to host applications. 
-The various tools provided by AWS such as monthly calculators faciliate anticipation of costs on deployments and comparisons to real world deployment.
