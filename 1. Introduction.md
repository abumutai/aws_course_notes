# Introduction

## Studying for Certification

Studying for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification involves:

- **Practical hands-on experience** - Working directly with AWS services
- **Memorizing facts and figures** - Understanding key concepts, limits, and specifications

## Exam Focus

Passing the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam does **not** require knowing how to provision and launch complex cloud deployments. Instead, it focuses on being **broadly familiar** with the workings of a wide range of AWS services.

### Key Takeaway

The exam tests breadth of knowledge across AWS services rather than deep technical implementation skills.
