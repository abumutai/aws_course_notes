# Chapter 3: Getting Support

## Overview

AWS provides layers of support that are designed to help in navigating the platform, learning the different ways of using the platform as well as securing and optimizing complex resources. 

## Key Concepts

### Support Plans 

AWS provides various models of support plans ranging from free to paid. 

#### Support Plan Pricing
The paid support plans on Amazon depends on total monthly usage. The total amount paid for support on a monthly basis is depended on the total amount spent per month which is usually calculated on a monthly basis.  


#### Basic Support Plans
On this plan, the customer does not pay any additional costs besides the regular costs of consuming the AWS resources. However, they get limited access to AWS support and are not eligible for a TrustAdvisor. 

#### Developer Support Plan
This plan is recommended for individuals or organizations which are running non-production workloads (Under development and less traffic). Under this plan, customers can only access support during business hours via emails and can only ask questions related to general advice on AWS use cases. 

#### Business Support Plan 
Provides fast and detailed answers to technical questions. It also includes support for troubleshooting AWS resources and third-party softwares and operating systems. 

#### Enterprise Support Plan
The plan is appropriate for large organizations with global scale who cannot afford to have downtimes. Under this plan such organizations are assigned technical account managers (TAM) responsible for guiding them in deployment, planning, lauching and reviews. Apart from the TAM organizations under this plan have access to 24/7 support from senior cloud support engineers. 


### AWS Professional Services
AWS Professional Services not only provides support but also detailed guides to achieving specific outcomes and work with third party partners to faciliate deployments. 


## Documentation and Online Help 
Apart from paid support plans, there are other multiple places where customers can obtain help regarding usage of AWS through self-help. 

### Documentation
AWS provides a lot of documentation resources hundreds of services together with tutorials and projects, toolkits, Software development kits (SDKs) and other general resources. 

### Knowledge Center
Contains links to thousands of questions arranged by service addressing common problems that most of the AWS customers experience. 

### Security Resources 
AWS maintains a page dedicated for useful and practical resources related to security. 

### Discussion Forums 
An online forum where customers can access questions asked by others who have experienced similar problems. 

## Trusted Advisor
A trusted advisor is responsible for confirming whether account resource configurations are sound and compliant to the best practices. They are organized into 5 categories:
1. **Cost Optimization**: Responsible for identifying any resources active and costly but underutilized e.g. EC2 instances that are mostly idle. 
2. **Performance**: Identifies configuration settings that could be responsible for blocking performance improvements. 
3. **Security**: Responsible for identifying any failures to use security best-practice configurations. 
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Identify resources which are vulnerable to service disruptions due to poor configuration.
5. **Service Limits**: Identifying resources which are almost reaching the AWS region and service limits. 


## Summary
There are multiple support plans in AWS that are billed according to total monthly resource usages.
